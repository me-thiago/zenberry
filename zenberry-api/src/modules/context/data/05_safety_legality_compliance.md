## 1. Legality (USA/Federal Context)
*Note: Zenberry operates in compliance with US federal legislation.*

* **2018 Farm Bill:** All Zenberry products are derived from *Industrial Hemp* and contain less than 0.3% Delta-9 THC by dry weight.
* **Legal Status:** Our products are federally legal for sale and interstate commerce.
* **Marijuana vs. Hemp:** Although they are the same species (*Cannabis sativa*), Hemp is legally defined as having low THC content (<0.3%) and does not cause intoxication.

## 2. The Drug Test Question
This is the most common question from professionals (drivers, military, athletes).

* **How tests work:** Most urine tests look for **THC** metabolites, not CBD.
* **The Full Spectrum Risk:** Full Spectrum products contain traces of THC. While the amount is small, daily use can accumulate in fatty tissue and trigger a **false positive**.
    * *Recommendation:* If you are subject to drug testing, **DO NOT USE Full Spectrum**.
* **The Safe Solution:** Opt for **Broad Spectrum** (THC-Free) or **Isolate** products.
    * *Transparency Warning:* Although we remove THC to non-detectable levels, extremely sensitive or low-quality lab tests can rarely yield false positives. Zenberry guarantees THC-free status in our lab reports (COAs), but consumption is at the customer's own risk in strict testing situations.

## 3. Drug Interactions (The Grapefruit Rule)
CBD is metabolized in the liver by a family of enzymes called **CYP450**. These same enzymes metabolize about 60% of pharmaceutical drugs (antidepressants, blood thinners, blood pressure meds).

* **The Grapefruit Rule:** If your medication has a sticker saying *"Do not eat grapefruit while taking this medication,"* you should proceed with caution regarding CBD.
* **What happens:** CBD can "occupy" the liver enzymes, causing the other medication to stay in your blood too long (risk of overdose) or be eliminated too fast (loss of effect).
* **Action:** Always consult your doctor if you are taking prescription medications.

## 4. Possible Side Effects
CBD is considered safe by the WHO, but high doses can cause mild discomfort:

1.  **Cottonmouth (Dry Mouth):** Caused by interaction with salivary glands. *Solution: Drink water.*
2.  **Drowsiness:** Sign that the dose was too high for the moment. *Solution: Reduce dose.*
3.  **Lightheadedness:** Slight drop in blood pressure.
4.  **Digestive Upset:** Usually caused by the carrier oil (MCT/Coconut) in sensitive stomachs, not the CBD itself.
