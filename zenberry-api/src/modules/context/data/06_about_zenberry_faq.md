    * No synthetic pesticides or fertilizers (cleaner end product).
    * Crop rotation to keep soil nutrient-dense (richer terpene profile).

In an unregulated industry, proof is everything. We test every single batch.

## 5. Institutional FAQ

**Q: Are Zenberry products Vegan and Gluten-Free?**
*A: Yes. All our oils are single-ingredient (Hemp + MCT). Our gummies use Pectin (fruit-based) instead of Gelatin (animal bone), making them 100% Vegan.*

**Q: Will this show up on my credit card statement as "Drugs"?**
*A: Absolutely not. It appears as "ZB WELLNESS LLC."*

**Q: Can I give my human oil to my dog?**
*A: Technically, if it is the "THC-Free Relief" oil, yes. However, human oils often have Peppermint or Citrus flavoring, which dogs hate and can cause stomach upset. We recommend the ZenPaws line for the appropriate bacon/chicken flavors and pet-specific dosing.*
