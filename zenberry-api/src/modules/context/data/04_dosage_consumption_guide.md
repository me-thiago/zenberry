## 1. MEDICAL DISCLAIMER (Must be quoted)
> "The following information is for educational purposes only regarding serving suggestions. Zenberry products are dietary supplements and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Always consult your veterinarian for pets or your physician for yourself, especially if you are taking prescription medications."

## 2. The Bioavailability Factor: It's Not What You Take, It's What You Absorb
A common mistake is thinking "20mg is 20mg." The delivery method changes the effective dose drastically.

| Method | Bioavailability (%) | Onset Time | Duration | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inhalation (Vape/Flower)** | 40-50% | Immediate | 2-3 Hours | *Not sold by Zenberry* |
| **Sublingual (Oil)** | **20-35%** | 15-30 Mins | 4-6 Hours | Anxiety attacks, Acute Pain |
| **Oral (Gummies/Capsules)** | 6-15% | 45-90 Mins | 6-8 Hours | Sleep, All-day relief |
| **Topical (Cream)** | <1% (Systemic) | Immediate | 3-4 Hours | Localized Joint/Muscle Pain |

* *Key Takeaway:* You may need a higher dose of Gummies to match the effect of a smaller dose of Oil.

## 3. The "Zenberry Titration Schedule" (How to Start)
The goal is to find the **Minimum Effective Dose** (MED). More is not always better (Bell Curve Effect).

* **Phase 1: The Introduction (Days 1-4)**
    * **Morning:** N/A
    * **Evening:** 10mg - 15mg CBD.
    * *Goal:* Check for sensitivity, allow body to recognize the compound.
* **Phase 2: The Evaluation (Days 5-7)**
    * **Morning:** 10mg (if needed for focus/anxiety).
    * **Evening:** 20mg.
    * *Goal:* Assess symptom relief. If you feel groggy, lower the dose. If pain persists, move to Phase 3.
* **Phase 3: The Optimization (Week 2+)**
    * Increase by 5mg increments every 3 days until the "Sweet Spot" is found.

## 4. Factors Influencing Dosage
1.  **Body Weight:** Heavier individuals generally require higher doses due to larger fat stores (CBD is fat-soluble).
2.  **Metabolism:** Fast metabolisms process CBD quicker (shorter duration).
3.  **Severity of Condition:** Mild anxiety might need 15mg; Chronic neuropathic pain might need 50mg+.
4.  **Tolerance:** Over months/years, you may develop a mild tolerance. A "T-Break" (tolerance break) of 48 hours can reset this.

## 5. How to Take (Technique Matters)
* **Oil Rule:** Do not swallow immediately! Hold under the tongue for **60-90 seconds**. This allows the CBD to enter the sublingual capillaries. If you swallow instantly, you waste 50% of the potency to digestive acids.
* **Gummy Rule:** Eat a healthy fat source (avocado, nuts, yogurt) with your gummy. Fat increases absorption by up to 300%.
