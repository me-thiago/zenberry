## 1. The Zenberry Standard: Clean Extraction
The quality of a CBD product is defined *before* it is bottled. Many cheap brands use Ethanol or Butane extraction (which leaves toxic residues). Zenberry uses **Supercritical CO2 Extraction**.

* **The Process:** We use pressurized carbon dioxide to strip the hemp plant of its oils at low temperatures.
* **The Result:** A solvent-free, medical-grade oil that preserves the delicate terpenes and flavonoids that are usually destroyed by heat. This ensures the product tastes better and works better.

## 2. Decoding the Spectrum: Which one is right for you?
The most confusing part for new customers is choosing between "Full Spectrum," "Broad Spectrum," and "Isolate." This is not about potency; it is about **Cannabinoid Profile**.

### Option A: Full Spectrum (Whole Plant)
* **Philosophy:** "Nature knows best." We keep everything naturally occurring in the plant.
* **Profile:** CBD + CBG + CBN + Terpenes + Trace THC (<0.3%).
* **The "Entourage Effect":** Scientific evidence suggests that cannabinoids work synergistically. 1+1=3. The presence of trace THC helps CBD bind 300% more effectively to receptors than CBD alone.
* **Best For:**
    * Severe/Chronic Pain (Arthritis, Back Pain).
    * Insomnia that resists other treatments.
    * Users who want the most potent therapeutic effect and don't mind trace THC.

### Option B: Broad Spectrum (The Safe Hybrid)
* **Philosophy:** "All the benefits, none of the risk."
* **The Process:** We take Full Spectrum oil and perform a specialized chromatography process to isolate and *remove* only the Delta-9 THC molecule.
* **Profile:** CBD + CBG + CBN + Terpenes + **0.0% THC**.
* **Why Choose This:** You still get the Entourage Effect from the other minor cannabinoids and terpenes, but you eliminate the risk of intoxication or drug test failure.
* **Best For:**
    * Anxiety and Stress relief.
    * Professionals (Pilots, Drivers, Nurses, Government).
    * Parents or those sensitive to THC.

### Option C: CBD Isolate (Pharmaceutical Purity)
* **Philosophy:** "Precision and Neutrality."
* **Profile:** 99.9% Pure CBD Molecule. No terpenes, no other cannabinoids.
* **Appearance:** A white, tasteless crystalline powder.
* **Why Choose This:** Some people have allergic reactions to specific terpenes or hemp plant matter. Isolate is the hypoallergenic option.
* **Best For:**
    * Cooking/Baking (no "grassy" flavor).
    * High-dose therapies where only CBD is required.
    * Extreme sensitivity to plant compounds.

## 3. Carrier Oils: Why MCT?
You cannot absorb CBD directly effectively; it is lipophilic (fat-loving).
* **Our Choice:** Organic MCT Oil (Fractionated Coconut Oil).
* **Why:** MCT (Medium Chain Triglycerides) are the fastest-digesting fats. They bypass standard digestion and go straight to the liver, acting as a "rapid transit vehicle" for the CBD, increasing absorption rates by 40-50% compared to olive or hemp seed oil.
